# Trajectory-Optimization

Trajectory Optimization in Matlab using fmincon function.

The goal is to find the optimized path to move from point A to B.

This program optimizes the path with help of minimization and constraint function.

The Matlab function fmincon uses the minimization and constraint functions to minimize the path.
